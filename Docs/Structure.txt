Use sub-dirs named by character, concept, usage etc.

<Project Name> - project root.
	Builds - executable builds are created here.
	Docs - design notes and the like are kept in here.
	Resources - Raw resources for assets used by the project. NOT used directly by the project source.
	Source - the source files for the project. The project.godot file is in here.
		addons - do not use directly; used for external Godot addons that are NOT GDNative.
		Assets - All physical assets - graphics, models, shaders, music etc. Store by category/usage.
			Audio - All sound files.
				Ambient - all looped sound effects. Filenames should include loop offset.
				Jingles - non-looped music files to be used for stings and things like starting a new game, ending an act, game over etc.
				Music - all looped music. Filenames should include loop offset.
				Sound - all non-looped sound effects.
			Common - non-audio, non-font assets used by multiple things.
			Fonts - fonts used throughout the game.
			Graphics - All graphical elements here, including shaders.
			Other - any other resource that might not fit any of the other categories.
			UI - Theme definitions for the user interface are stored here.
		GDNative - do not use directly; used for external Godot addons that ARE GDNative (e.g. external libraries, bindings for other languages), in separate folders for each.
		Scenes - all the "scenes" used in the game. Should mirror Scripts.
			Singletons - non-game(play) related scenes. For autoload/general-purpose singletons that contain nodes/scripts for convenience use.

Audio bus structure:
Master
	Jingles
	Music
	SFX - unlooped sound effects.
	Ambient - looped sound effects.
DON'T add effects to Jingles/Music/SFX directly - create separate buses as needed for this!

Default physics/rendering layers:
2D rendering: 1 = layer_render_default
2D physics: 1 = layer_physics_default; 20 = layer_physics_disabled

For functions called by/connected to signals, use the function name styled as <nodename>_on_<signal type>, e.g. btnQuit_on_press

Autoload bus structure:
	helper_functions
	random_helpers
	sound_player
	music_player
	jingle_player
	config_helper
